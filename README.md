This mod is in early development and only adds two planet types right now.
It's a 50/50 chance to get the normal starting planet or the new starting planet.

As more planet types are added, worlds generated with older versions of the mod may change. 
I recommend you do not update unless starting a new game, or are okay with your planet themes changing between versions.

## Features
- Adds several new planet types to the game.
	* Giant Forest
	* Red Forest
	* Molten World
	* Sulphurous Sea
- Adds one new spawn planet to the game.
	* Giant Forest Start

###### Winding rivers and trees far taller than Icarus. A possible starting planet.

#### Molten World
###### An even hotter, more hellish lava world for you to conquer.
